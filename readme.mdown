## Muscle Fatigue Analysis Based On sEMG Signals - The Final Project For Human Motion Analysis Course

In this project we demostrate how to measure the extent of fatig by calculating the change of median frequency over time.
This repository is meant to provide a backup for our team so the readme isn't going to be exquisite.

*Note that in our MATLAB program, median frequency isn't exactly calculated by definition, but to my best knowledge it still serve the purpose*
